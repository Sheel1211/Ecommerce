1. npm init in ecommerce folder and set entry point as backend/server.js.
2. npm i express mongoose dotenv.
3. any name can be given to config.env. we downloaded dotenv so that server.js can understand that port number is written inside config.env file.
4. write this in package.json
    "start":"node backend/server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon backend/server.js"
5. We used async handler to handle async errors.like our validation for name is required and if we dont give name then request goes into infinity loop so to stop it we use async handler.

6. error handlers given:
(1) Cast error = for giving wrong id
(2)unhandled promise rejection = to close the server on server crashing due to wrong url or anything.
(3)catchasyncerrors= to handle errors like not passing name and its validator is set to required.
(4)Uncaught Exception = e.g: console.log(youtube)  i.e we use it if we try to print variables that are not defined.
